- **User privacy:** No user data is stored or logged by this application. All processing happens locally, except when using LLMs (OpenAI), which is opt-in and clearly indicated.
- **Environment safety:** `.env` files with API keys are never committed to version control. Only `.env.example` (with mock keys) is shared.
- **Transparency:** Users are informed when data is sent to any external service (e.g., OpenAI for LLM-powered responses).
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - This tool is for informational and educational purposes only and is **not** a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
  - All outputs should be reviewed by a qualified healthcare professional before any real-world use.
- **Bias and fairness:** The system is designed to minimize bias, but LLMs and data sources may have limitations. Feedback is welcome to improve fairness and accuracy.

*Ethics and privacy are core values‚Äîplease report any concerns or suggestions for improvement.*

---

## üöß Limitations & Future Work

**Current Limitations:**
- Uses mock agent logic unless a real OpenAI API key is provided (no real clinical LLMs by default).
- No real patient data‚Äîonly synthetic or sample data for privacy and safety.
- Diagnosis and recommendations are not clinically validated.
- Potential LLM/model bias and limitations in medical accuracy.
- UI/UX optimized for general use, but not certified for accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) or clinical deployment.
- Limited dataset (`symptoms_data.csv`); not comprehensive for all conditions.

**Future Work:**
- Integrate with real, production-grade LLMs and enable more advanced reasoning.
- Expand dataset to include more symptoms, demographic factors, and clinical guidelines.
- Add more specialized agents (e.g., triage, risk assessment, follow-up scheduling).
- Support for multi-language and internationalization.
- Conduct clinical validation and usability studies.
- Enhance accessibility to meet formal standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Add user feedback loop for continuous improvement.

*This project is a foundation for research and innovation‚Äîcontributions and suggestions are welcome!*

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & RAG Pipeline

Below is a high-level overview of how user input flows through the system, illustrating the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and multi-agent orchestration:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Input - Symptoms and Profile] --> B[Symptom Retriever - Embeddings and DB]
    B --> C[Diagnostic Agent]
    C -- Follow-up Needed --> D[User]
    C -- Diagnosis Ready --> E[Recommendation Agent]
    E --> F[Explanation Agent]
    F --> G[UI - Chat Diagnosis Advice]
    D --> C
    C -. Context and History .-> E
    C -. Context and History .-> F
    style A fill:#ffe082,stroke:#232526
    style G fill:#1f8ef1,stroke:#232526,color:#fff
```

**Legend:**
- **Symptom Retriever:** Finds relevant medical knowledge using semantic search.
- **Diagnostic Agent:** Asks dynamic follow-ups or provides diagnosis.
- **Recommendation Agent:** Gives advice based on diagnosis & profile.
- **Explanation Agent:** Explains reasoning behind results.
- **UI:** Presents step-by-step interaction, results, and advice to the user.

## üîÑ Sequence Diagram: Multi-Agent Diagnostic Flow

This diagram illustrates a typical multi-turn interaction, showing how the user, UI, retriever, and agents collaborate step by step:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as Streamlit UI
    participant R as Symptom Retriever
    participant D as Diagnostic Agent
    participant Rec as Recommendation Agent
    participant Exp as Explanation Agent

    U->>UI: Describe symptoms
    UI->>D: Send user input & profile
    D->>R: Retrieve relevant symptoms
    R-->>D: Top match & context
    D->>UI: Return follow-up question
    UI->>U: Display follow-up
    U->>UI: Answer follow-up
    UI->>D: Send answer
    D->>R: Retrieve updated context
    R-->>D: New context
    D->>UI: Return diagnosis
    UI->>Rec: Request recommendation
    Rec->>UI: Return advice
    UI->>Exp: Request explanation
    Exp->>UI: Return reasoning
    UI->>U: Display diagnosis, advice, explanation
```

---

## How It Works (Simple Terms)
1. **You describe your symptoms** in the chat interface.
2. **The AI asks smart follow-up questions** to clarify your condition.
3. **After a few questions,** the AI gives a likely diagnosis and a recommendation (e.g., see a doctor, try home remedies).
4. **You also get an explanation** in plain English about why the AI reached its conclusion.
5. **All AI responses are powered by OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models** (if enabled), with automatic key rotation to avoid downtime.

---

## Usage

- **Local/mock mode:** Leave `OPENAI_API_KEYS` blank or commented in `.env` to run with mock logic (no LLM calls).
- **Production/LLM mode:** Add your OpenAI keys to `.env` for real GPT-powered responses.
- **CLI agent tests:**  
  ```bash
  python -m agents.agent_orchestrator
  python -m agents.diagnostic_agent
  python -m agents.recommendation_agent
  python -m agents.explanation_agent
  ```
---

## For Technical Users: Architecture & Extending
- **All OpenAI calls go through `utils/openai_client.py`** for key rotation and maintainability.
- **Add new agents or logic** by extending the `agents/` directory and updating the orchestrator.
- **Environment variables** are loaded automatically via `python-dotenv`.
- **Testing:**
  - Run `pytest` to check core logic.
  - For real OpenAI integration, run agent scripts directly (e.g., `python -m agents.explanation_agent`).

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ
- **No response from AI?**
  - Check your `.env` file and make sure your keys are valid and not exhausted.
- **UI looks strange?**
  - Make sure you‚Äôre using a modern browser and have not edited `styles.css`.
- **Quota errors?**
  - Add more OpenAI keys to `.env` for better rotation.
- **Want to see which key is used?**
  - Add a print statement in `utils/openai_keys.py` in `get_random_openai_key()`.

---

## Security & Privacy
- **Never commit `.env` to git!**
- **Share `.env.example` only** (it contains placeholders, not real keys).
- **All user data is ephemeral and local.**
